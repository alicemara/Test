# Setting up a wireless access point  

What if you need a wireless access point thats easy to setup and use? Did you ever hear the setup of Unifi The Wireless? I thought not. It’s not a story the home network enthusiasts would tell you...  

If you connect a Unifi wireless AP ([I used this one](https://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Access-Adapter-Included-U6-Lite-US/dp/B08QG92M83/))to a switch connected to your brand new OPNsense box (that was made in a pervious guide, but you could use this on almost any setwork setup) you can set up a *single* wireless access point. You can do this by connecting to it with the Unifi mobile app. I have included step by step directions using the iOS app.

Open up the app, and select "Set Up a New Device"

It will likely not be able to find it. Hit "Other Setup Options"

And then "Standalone UniFi Access Point"

Use your device's camera to scan the QR code on the bottom on the AP

Tell it to connect (it will ask to join as well, hit "join")

Once connected, you will be taken back to your home screen. Select the newly connected AP

Tell it to continue without consle (remember this is a singular AP)

Name the AP (this *isn't* the SSID)

Give it a SSID and password to be able to connect with your devices

It will go ahead and configure the device

Once completed, it will ask to join your network, do so

This may take a minute to do

Once completed, you are all done! You can reconfigure at any time with the app.

You can use more then one Unifi AP if you have additional equipment such as a physical controller, but this guide is just for a standalone. You can also use any number of other brands APs, this is just what I had on hand.  

Is it possible to learn these other setups?  

Not from this guide.
