## **Manual setup guide**

Setting up everything manually involves 2 main guides:
- The EC2_Manual_Setup will walk you through setting up, configuring your EC2 instance via the console, as well as setting up the pihole and Wireguard server.
- After that is the OPNsense_guide, which walks you through setting up a local machine that you can tunnel all of your traffic with directly to your EC2 instance.

If you would like an easy way to set up a singular wireless access point, there is the Unifi_AP guide.

Simple as that!
